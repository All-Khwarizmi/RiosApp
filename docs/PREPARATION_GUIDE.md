# Preparation Guide for PHP Application Deployment on GCP

This guide outlines the necessary steps and checks to prepare a PHP application for successful deployment on Google Cloud Platform using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Properly configured development environment with PHP, Docker, and Google Cloud SDK installed.
- Access to Google Cloud Platform with appropriate permissions.
- Knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes basics.

## Preparation Steps

### 1. Configure Your PHP Application

Ensure your PHP application is configured properly for a production environment:

- **Configure Apache or PHP-FPM:** Ensure your web server is correctly configured in your Dockerfile. For Apache, you might need to customize the `.htaccess` or Apache config files to handle URL rewrites and redirects properly.

- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information such as database credentials in environment variables or Kubernetes secrets rather than hard-coding them into your application.

- **Error Handling:** Configure PHP error handling to not display errors on the production server. Use logging instead.

- **Optimizations:** Enable opcache and other relevant PHP extensions for better performance.

### 2. Test Locally

Before deploying, thoroughly test your application in a local environment that mimics the production setup as closely as possible:

- **Docker Compose:** Use Docker Compose to run your application with all its dependencies (e.g., MySQL, Redis) to ensure everything works as expected.
  - [Dockerize PHP App](https://docs.docker.com/language/php/containerize/)
  - [Docker Compose Documentation For PHP App](https://docs.docker.com/language/php/develop/)

- **Performance Testing:** Conduct load testing and optimize database queries to handle expected traffic volumes.
